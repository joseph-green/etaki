get to the point
bring them to their knees
make up your mind
build bridges
raise eyebrows
come to blows
home truth
hot potato
tie the knot
quantum leap
flog a dead horse
have eyes only for
man in blue
curl your lip
act your age
couch potato
chew the cud
feel your age
cut throat
good samaritan
testing the waters
chew the fat
hit your ceiling
sacred cow
clock out
wine and dine
silver fox
play a joke
give me your hand
spill the beans
grin like a cheshire cat
cash cow
leave no stone unturned
stop by
hit the sack
let your heart rule your head
start from scratch
not bat an eyelid
bite the dust
kill time
scratch your head
jump to conclusions
jump the gun
be on cloud nine
get the ball rolling
stick to your guns
meet your waterloo
come of age
ahead of their time
shoot straight
join the club
keep your eyes peeled
draw the shortest straw
big wheel
go dutch
take a dim view of
basket case
the bottom line is
find your feet
big head
easy on the ear
white elephant
hang in there
wax and wane
smell a rat
music to your ears
see eye to eye
pick up the tab
bring to the table
unwritten law
new arrival
beach bum
throw in the towel
war of words
burn your fingers
bank on
keep at bay
strike a chord
save face
lose your shirt
snake in the grass
pull the wool over your eyes
scrape together
fall prey to
ask out
go for broke
miss the boat
bag lady
make waves
watch the clock
go through the roof
take breath away
fight like cat and dog
say your piece
bend over backwards
sleep on it
put on a brave face
cross my fingers
nurse back to health
a man of action
put your shoulder to the wheel
sail close to the wind
a place in the sun
come clean
wag the dog
burn candles at both ends
see the point
wear off
carry the ball
love to death
watch your language
thumbnail sketch
steal your thunder
come to terms with
lay down the law
wet blanket
get on my nerves
burn the midnight oil
hit the road
have guts
come out of the closet
paint the town red
catch my eye
man of means
forbidden fruit
life-saver
stitch up
love nest
give the kiss of life
fire your imagination
banana republic
nail it
running battle
keep tabs on
come from behind
stiff upper lip
fill their shoes
reinvent the wheel
scarlet woman
bend the law
call a spade a spade
take for a ride
stir up a hornets' nest
play ball
wild-goose chase
come true
swing by
beyond your wildest dreams
keep body and soul together
self-made man
turn back the clock
pay your dues
drag your feet
go out on a limb
keep it cool
hit the roof
sell your soul to the devil
trip a light fantastic
come to my attention
play away from home
stage whisper
keeping your fingers crossed
get in my hair
butter up
spitting image
bite your tongue
party animal
jump off the deep end
get your act together
be dead to the world
tighten your belt
play safe
go back to the drawing board
easy on the eye
pulling your leg
stand the test of time
blind date
peeping tom
watch your mouth
take a hike
kick the bucket
lose your head
gas up
fall on deaf ears
be in hot water
add insult to injury
come out of the woodwork
come under fire
black sheep
beef up
be an item
do the trick
beat the clock
virgin territory
fan the flames
shoot through
have a blast
jump on the bandwagon
break your back
shiver down your spine
cry wolf
pick your brain
hit the nail on the head
gain ground
breathe at last
bite your lip
play devil's advocate
back on your feet
fight fire with fire
wear your heart on your sleeve
blow a fuse
pass the buck
pitch in
have big ears
have kittens
worth its weight in gold
run like the wind
cost an arm and a leg
night owl
come to my head
work my fingers to the bone
dead loss
be sick and tired of
sweat blood
go with the flow
scream blue murder
play cat and mouse
take a stab at
give the cold shoulder
keep in touch
drop the ball
call the shots
pull the plug
yes man
run out of steam
behind your back
new kid on the block
run for your life
keep an eye open
play the field
lose touch
bury the hatchet
bring the curtain down
keep your head above water
father figure
know the ropes
sit tight
kiss and make up
dark horse
poison pill
fall out of love
leave the nest
bring home the bacon
pull your leg
get out of hand
track record
rabbit hole
be in black and white
shake in your shoes
draw fire
eat humble pie
laugh up your sleeve
a man of few words
blue-eyed boy
kangaroo court
make yourself at home
shift gears
add fuel to thefire
have a whale of a time
cat burglar
cut the mustard
chicken out
loose cannon
ring the bell
fight the good fight
alley cat
be in deep water
get over it
company man
war of nerves
pipe down
work like a charm
read the riot act
bet your bottom dollar
harp on
word is law
pig out
do the dirty work
drive me up a wall
drink like a fish
red tape
walk on air
pop the question
name a day
bear fruit
have friends in high places
drive a hard bargain
twist my arm
get on board
throw caution to the wind
speak the same language
foam at the mouth
turn the tables
weather the storm
put a cat among pigeons
bite the bullet
strike a balance
men in suits
put the cart before the horse
keep an eye on
lame duck
big cheese
peg out
break up
lift the curtain
make no bones about
cut corners
get religion
make a scene
walk of life
go bananas
bad egg
let me off the hook
ride shotgun
break the ice
hit the sack
turn a blind eye
law of the jungle
make my mouth water
learn by heart
old chestnut
walk out on
brought forward
red flag
give the slip
pull the trigger
take a bull by the horns
whet my appetite
be under no illusions
drop the subject
cut your losses
swim against the tide
read between the lines
come to fruition
hop in
on the ball
raw deal
black out
drop a bombshell
aching heart
quake in my boots
prick up their ears
